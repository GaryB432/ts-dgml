# DGML for Node

Tools for [Directed Graph Markup Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DGML).


## Install

$ npm install ts-dgml

## API
```js
var graph = new dgml.DirectedGraph();
graph.nodes.push(new dgml.Node("car", "car"));
graph.nodes.push(new dgml.Node("truck", "truck"));
graph.links.push(graph.createLink("car", "truck"));
console.log(dgml.nodeXml.Serializer(graph).toDgml());
```
produces this
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<DirectedGraph xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/vs/2009/dgml">
    <Nodes>
        <Node Id="car" Label="car"/>
        <Node Id="truck" Label="truck"/>
    </Nodes>
    <Links>
        <Link Source="car" Target="truck"/>
